git config --global user.email "your.user.name@example.com"

git remote add upstream git@github.com:ykaitao/setting-up-a-professional-data-science-environment.git # Get remote upstream master from git_url_of_another_project
git remote -v # Check how many remote branches
```

# Make changes on your `local` machine
```bash
git checkout -b <new_branch> # Create a new branch and switch to it, coping everything from current branch to the new branch.
git branch # Print all the local branches, your current branch starts with *.
```

# Push changes from `local` to `origin remote`
```bash
git add <file> # Register the changes of the file.
git commit -m <'your comments' ># Make comments about the changes.
git push # Push the changes from local to remote.
git push --set-upstream origin branch # If this is the first time that this branch being pushed.

# Clean up branches
```bash
git checkout master
git branch -D <branch_to_be_deleted> # Delete a branch from local.
git push origin :<branch_to_be_deleted> # Delete a branch from remote.
git push origin --delete <branch_to_be_deleted> # Delete a branch from remote.
```

# Update your `local` from `upstream remote`
```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master master
```

# How do I update a GitHub forked repository?
```bash
# Add the remote, call it "upstream":
git remote add upstream https://github.com/whoever/whatever.git

# Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches
git fetch upstream

# Make sure that you're on your master branch:
git checkout master

# Rewrite your master branch so that any commits of yours that
# aren't already in upstream/master are replayed on top of that
# other branch:
git rebase upstream/master
```
